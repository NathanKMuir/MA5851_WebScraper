This project focuses on the development of web scraping applications and NLP solutions to aid open-source intelligence operations. The WebCrawler trawls Twitter for posts related to a given search term that occur within a given time period. The first NLP task relates to the identification of tweets which have intelligence value based on emotion identification. The second task is concerned with named entity recognition, and specifically the retrieval of organisation and location information from a tweet.

There are three main directories available in this space. 'Legacy' relates to older versions of this project, which aren't relevant to the assessment but are relevant to the work undertaken in the background to design the scripting invovled. 'Scraper' refers to all functionality relating to the development of the WebCrawler. 'Models' relates to the two NLP and ML tasks undertaken as part of this assessment.  

Most scripts are segmented to allow for easier editing and lowers the number of changes that need to be made upon amendments by members of the development team, ensuring that output files are the currency in which this project relies on. 

Several CSV files are provided throughout this repository allowing the user to 'jump in' at different points of the process. Please read the item description to learn more about the application of each file.
